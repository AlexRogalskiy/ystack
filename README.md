Y-stack is higly opinionated:
It says "registry" to refer to a Docker registry with a particular setup,
while "knative" refers to an installer that combines Knative modules.
The point with being opinionated is that registry and knative work well together.

The stack supports local developmment using Skaffold with local and remote clusters alike.
Image builds during development are in-cluster:
Many dev setups transfer container images but we transfer the build context.
We see builds as temporary and per-cluster,
though they upon different kinds of verification can be pushed to a productiono registry.
Build contexts are small and there's no need to git push to trigger a build.

Y-stack should be independent of cluster vendor,
but we provide some utilities like [microk8s-multipass.sh](./microk8s-multipass.sh) to automate cluster creation.
Note that these scripts don't actually apply anything.
Actually installing y-stack is done through `kubectl apply -k [path(s) in this repo]`.

## TLS certificate for https

A crucial part of modern development is to access your stack using `https://`.
For that you need a valid SSL certificate.
If your cluster has a public IP we assume that you can get real valid certificats,
through for example LetsEncrypt.

If your cluster has a local IP you'll probably want something like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).
It needs to run locally, so y-stack can't automate much, but some assistance is provided in the form of:
 - A Kustomize base for ingress at [ingress-tls-local](./ingress-tls-local/) which as base for actual ingress resources helps with the transfer of a local cert to in-cluster Ingress.
 - A utility [tls-local.sh](./tls-local.sh) to (re)generate certs for all `host:` entries in any ingress resource.

Unless you have a local DNS that gets updated with your ingress entries,
you'll probably also want to update your /etc/hosts file.
For that we use https://github.com/solsson/k8s-ingress-hosts/releases
