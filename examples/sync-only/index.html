This file will only be hosted (by the runtime container) after <code>skaffold dev</code> and modification.

The example could be a bit lighter if:
<ul>
<p>The <code>NOTHING_IMAGE</code>; was already in the target repo. Crane cp would be faster.</p>
<p>The image had a nonroot <code>USER</code>. We could remove <code>securityContext</code>.</p>
<p>The image had a sleep entrypoint. We could remove the <code>command</code>.</p>
<p>With https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58512 we wouldn't need tar in the image.</p>
</ul>
